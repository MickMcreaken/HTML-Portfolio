<hr>

<h3>1. Avatar</h3>
<p>The special effects were fantastic, the world was immersive, and it was the first movie I was ever able to enjoy with the new 3d technology.</p>

<h3>2. Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy</h3>
<p>Based on one of my favorite books of all time, it is the most ironically entertaining movies I have ever seen</p>

<h3>3. Idiocracy</h3>
<p>Well on its way to being a social documentary, this was just a feel good movie.</p>
